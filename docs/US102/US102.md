## *Decision Making*
With the knowledge we had to date, the group decided to not develop the three trees in order not to be tripling the system information, despite the search for the imo and the callsign not being the most efficient as if it existed in the trees. We do the efficient search by mmsi and then we choose to do it by inOrder () to run the whole tree looking for the ship.

## *Complexity Analysis*
Concretely analysing the complexity of the algorithm related to US102
(shipExistByMMSI) using the measure of time (temporal complexity) we conclude that
the algorithm has logarithmic complexity (O(log2n)).
This method looks for an element in an AVL tree, balanced binary tree.
Concretely analysing the complexity of the algorithm related to US102(shipExistByIMO()
or shipExistByCallSign()) using the measure of time (temporal complexity) we conclude
that the algorithm has polynomial complexity of degree 1 (O(n)).
The first for loop is executed n times plus one(O(n+1)), this last time being the loop
condition checking (and failure).
The US remains with complexity O(n).
